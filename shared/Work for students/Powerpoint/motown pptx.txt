You are to research your assigned topic, and then create a Powerpoint of at least 12 to 16 slides (Motown), and post the presentation on this forum. Your presentation should address the following questions: Title slide: Topic, your name, etc. Dates related to topic (birth, death, date of a relevant event, etc.) Biography/desсrіption: If a person, discuss his/her achievements; also, what impact this person/event/topic had on later history. Provide some context by discussing events related to your topic. Why is this person/thing important? How does the topic relate to something we have discussed in the class? Ideally, this should take up several slides--I have selected some interesting persons/topics; tell the story: have fun with it! Memorials/legacies (anything named or created in memory of the person, event, or item, and why); you can also discuss any recent news or controversies related to your topic, or maybe a cultural reference (Or: Is there a movie about your topic?) Interesting or unusual thing you learned about this person or event (or related)—feel free to cast a wide net in discussing anything related to your topic. Pictures, map or some illustration—anything which enhances the discussion! (Note: don’t use the same illustration multiple times—that defeats the point of the exercise.) Sources slide: At least two sources, one of which should be an SPCC library database, properly cited (MLA).
